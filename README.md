# K_Nearest_Neighbours-
K nearest neighbours model on a simple data:

           
           It is a non linear classification algorithm which classifies the data points based on 
        k data points near to that data point. The k value must be choosen and is one of the 
        parameter while creating the object of this algorithm class. The nearest data points can 
        be found out by many methods like euclidian distance,manhattan distance, minkowski distance.
        etc.. In the code euclidian distance is used which is same as minkowski distance of order 2.
        The algorithm finds k neighbours by the selected distance calculator and checks their class.
        The class or category having highest number of neighbours among these neighours is assigned
        to that data point.
